# ETL Pipeline for Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is focused on creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python to process sales data from January 2009. The process involves extracting data from a CSV file, performing necessary transformations to clean and standardize the data, and then loading it into a SQLite database for in-depth analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting the ETL process.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and transformation.
- **SQL**: Used for database interactions.

## Installation and Setup
Ensure Python is installed on your system and it is recommended to use a virtual environment for project dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd etl_project
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - The project uses Pandas for data manipulation and SQL for database operations.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## File Structure
- `data/SalesJan2009.csv`: Contains the raw sales data for January 2009.
- `data/data_extraction/`: This directory houses the script for the data extraction phase of the ETL process.

## Running the ETL Pipeline
To execute the ETL pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Execute the Extraction Script**:
   - Navigate to the data extraction directory.
   - Run the extraction script:
     ```bash
     python extract.py
     ```
   - Observe the results of the extraction process.


## Additional Notes
The `extract.py` script is responsible for the initial phase of the ETL pipeline, where data is extracted and prepared for transformation. Ensure you have the correct path to `SalesJan2009.csv` in your script.

Optimization:
Created a new module for commonly used files throughput the project.
This is done for clean code and have common module for reuse.
