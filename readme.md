# ETL Pipeline for Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python to process sales data from January 2009. The pipeline extracts data from a CSV file, performs necessary transformations to clean and standardize the data, and then loads it into a SQLite database for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- SQL (Database)

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. 

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd etl_project
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## File Structure
- `data/SalesJan2009.csv`: The raw sales data file.
- data/data_extraction : Contains the script for data extraction
- Run the script:
 python extract.py




## How to Run
1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the ETL script:
   ```
   python etl.py
   ```

## ETL Process
### Extract
- Reads data from `SalesJan2009.csv`.

### Transform
- Standardizes date formats.
- Handles missing values and cleans text fields.
- Adds or modifies necessary columns for analysis.

### Load
- Creates a table in the SQLite database.
- Loads transformed data into the database.

## Future Work
- Implement data visualization using Python libraries.
- Enhance the database schema for more complex queries.
- Automate the pipeline to run at scheduled intervals.
